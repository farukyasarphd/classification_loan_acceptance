# Loan Acceptance Prediction Model (Classification)

ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**
Predict customer loan acceptance to identify factors influencing their decisions. This will help to focus the required effort and the cost on the customers who are most likely to accept the loan offer.

ðŸŽ¯ **The Approach** 
Minimize False Negatives (maximize Recall) to improve targeting of customers likely to accept offers.

ðŸ“ˆ **Business Impact**
Enhanced targeting efficiency
Reduced missed opportunities for loan conversions

ðŸ¤” **The Challenge**
The data is significantly imbalanced in favor of rejection of the loan offer. 

Target Variable Distribution (Personal Loan):
-  Accepted: 9.6%
-  Not Accepted: 90.4%

## Project Structure
This repository structure:
- `/data`: Contains datasets (raw and processed).
  - `/raw`: Holds unprocessed data files.
  - `/processed`: Stores cleaned, transformed and balanced data.
- `/notebooks`: Jupyter notebooks for analysis and modeling.
- `/src`: Source code modules for reusable functions and pipelines.
- `/docs`: Documentation files.

## Environment Setup and Usage
This project is built and managed using Poetry for dependency management. The main analysis is explained in the Analysis.ipynb notebook. To reproduce and run the notebook follow the steps below to set up the environment.

1. Prerequisites

- Install dependencies using Poetry (in the terminal):
  poetry install
- Activate the virtual environment (in the terminal):
  poetry shell

3. Running the Notebook
- Start Jupyter Notebook (in the terminal):
  jupyter notebook
- Open the analysis notebook in your browser and run the cells.
